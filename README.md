# Factorio-AltAircraftTech
Modifies Lex's Aircraft technologies to fit with Helicopter Revival. All features are optional and can be disabled.

### Features
- Helicopter Rivival tech now requires robotics instead of rocketry. Makes them available with robots (that uses the same tech to fly).
- Lex's Aircraft techs depend on Helicopter Revival. VTOL as a more specialized helicopter.
- If Space Exploration is enabled removes the space science pack usage.
- If Space Exploration is enabled and the space science packs are disabled adds back the normal science packs to use (Utility & Production).
- Reduces the Heavyship tech cost from 2500 to 1000-1500 depending on your enabled features above.
